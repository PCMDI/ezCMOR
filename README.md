The PCMDI ezCMOR package is used to rewrite observational data to conform with [CF-Conventions](http://cfconventions.org/) and [CMIP data standards](http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/output_req.html).

PCMDI ezCMOR is a front end to an existing free software package, CMOR2 (Climate Model Output Rewriter), written by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), and reads in a multitude of standard data formats, such as netcdf3, netcdf4, Grads control files, Matlab data files or a list of netcdf files, and converts the data into the CMIP5 data format to allow publication on the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) data node.
